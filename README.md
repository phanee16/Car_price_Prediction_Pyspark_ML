# Car_price_Prediction_Pyspark_ML
As the automotive industry grows increasingly competitive, automakers are constantly seeking ways to better understand their customers and gain a competitive edge. One crucial factor in this quest is predicting the price of new vehicles, which can be a challenging task given the multitude of variables that influence car prices. To tackle this problem, I undertook a project using PySpark MLâ€™s Random Forest Regressor algorithm to analyze the Car MSRPs dataset and develop a predictive model for car prices. This project represents a novel approach to analyzing car price data and has the potential to revolutionize the way automakers approach pricing strategy. In this article, I will detail my approach, results, and insights gained from this project.
